Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 3

Output: 

*****
 ***
  *

Solution:

for i in range(n):
        spaces = i          # spaces increase by 1 each line
        stars = 2 * (n - i) - 1  # stars decrease by 2 each line
        print(' ' * spaces + '*' * stars)

with nested loops:

for i in range(n):
        # Print leading spaces
        for _ in range(i):
            print(' ', end='')
        
        # Calculate number of stars for the line
        stars = 2 * (n - i) - 1
        
        # Print stars
        for _ in range(stars):
            print('*', end='')
        
        # Move to the next line
        print()
