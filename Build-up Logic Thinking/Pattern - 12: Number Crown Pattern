Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 

1         1
1 2     2 1
1 2 3 3 2 1

Solution:
def numberCrown(N: int) -> None:
    # Write your solution here.
    spaces = 2*(N-1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        # Print increasing numbers from 1 to i
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            print(j, end='')
        
        # Print spaces in the middle
        for _ in range(spaces):
            print(' ', end='')
        
        # Print decreasing numbers from i to 1
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            print(j, end='')
        
        # Move to next line after each row
        print()
        
        # Decrease the number of spaces by 2 for next row
        spaces -= 2
