Problem statement
Aryan and his friends are very fond of the pattern. For a given integer ‘N’, they want to make the Reverse N-Number Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 

1 2 3
1 2
1

Solution:
def nNumberTriangle(n: int) -> None:
    # Write your solution here.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            print(j, end = " ")
        print()
