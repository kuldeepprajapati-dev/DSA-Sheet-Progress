Problem statement
Ninja was very fond of patterns. For a given integer ‘N’, he wants to make the N-Star Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 

  *
 ***
*****

Solution:


def nStarTriangle(n: int) -> None:
    # Write your code here.
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # print spaces first
        for space in range(n - i):
            print(" ", end="")
        # print stars: (2 * i - 1) stars per row
        for star in range(2 * i - 1):
            print("*", end="")
        print()
